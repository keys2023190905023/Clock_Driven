# Digital Circuits × Intelligence — Learning, Building, Exploring
> Welcome to this repository, curated by an undergraduate student from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Glasgow College (Class of 2023), passionate about the intersection of digital circuit design and intelligent computing.

## What’s in this repository?
This repository serves as a growing collection of:

* Fundamental digital design projects using VHDL/Verilog

* Simulation-based experiments (Vivado + XSim)

* Practical notes and diagrams on key topics such as finite state machines (FSMs), arithmetic logic units (ALUs), sequential logic, clock design, 和 low-level timing

* Exploratory projects that combine AI models with hardware-level logic, such as:

* Neural network accelerators on RTL

* Logic synthesis for AI-oriented architectures

* Bit-serial inference engines and edge AI prototyping

## Why this matters
Digital logic is the foundation of modern computing. But in the age of AI, there's a pressing need to rethink hardware from the ground up—not just as a substrate for software, but as an active co-designer of intelligent behavior.

This project reflects a dual-track learning journey: mastering classical digital logic while probing how intelligent systems can be realized more efficiently at the silicon level.

## Tech Stack
* Languages: VHDL, Verilog, Python (for AI hardware simulation)

* Tools: Vivado, XSim, ModelSim, NumPy, PyVerilator

* Hardware Platforms: Xilinx Artix-7 (e.g., Nexys A7), planned support for Zynq & FPGAs with AI overlay

## For fellow learners
Whether you're a beginner diving into flip-flops and logic gates, or a researcher exploring edge AI optimization, this repo aims to:

Offer clean, well-documented code

Share insights from coursework & projects at UESTC

Serve as a public lab notebook for advanced exploration# Clock_Driven
